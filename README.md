# 3-LEAF-
3 LEAF ( a card game ) made with plain Vanilla JS


3 Leaf is a short simple card game played in my country ( Papua New Guinea )
- The rules are simple. Each player is dealt 3 cards 

In 3 leaf cards have values, "Ace" is equal to 1,
2, is of course equal to 2, 3 is equal to 3 and so on.

Jack is after 10 so it is 11, Queen is 12 and King is 13


After the players get their 3 cards they have to add the values
of their 3 cards and then compare it with the other players.

Whoever has the higest sum wins. 

( I have no idea why it is called 3 leaf tho )



For each player I made 3 variables each equal to 3 random numbers ( between 1 and 13 ) 
These are the 3 random cards each player has every round.

I get the sum of each variable and store it in a variable.
And then compare the sums for every player

Whoever has the higest wins.
If two people have the higest value it is a draw between those two players
If everyone has the same value it is a Total Draw


I named the players after my friends in real life but you can change the names hehe
